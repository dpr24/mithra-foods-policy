        <h2 class="section-title">Advertising ID</h2>
        <h3>1. Information Collection</h3>
        <h4>a. Device Information and Advertising ID (AD ID)</h4>
        <p>Our app may collect certain device information, including the Advertising ID (AD ID), which is used to uniquely identify a device for advertising purposes. Although our app does not display ads, certain third-party services integrated into our app may request the AD ID for other purposes, such as analytics or crash reporting.</p>

        <h4>b. Third-Party Services</h4>
        <p>We use the following third-party services, which may indirectly collect or request the AD ID:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services - Wallet:</strong> Used for payment processing and access to Google Pay. While this service may access certain device information, it does not directly use the AD ID in our app.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Messaging:</strong> This service is used for sending notifications and updates. Firebase Messaging may collect device information, including AD ID, for tracking engagement metrics, especially when linked with Firebase Analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> We use Google Sign-In to allow users to authenticate via their Google accounts. Google Sign-In does not directly use the AD ID for authentication but may access device information to facilitate a seamless login experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Used to track and log app crashes, which helps us improve app stability. Firebase Crashlytics may collect device identifiers and may use the AD ID indirectly, especially when linked with other Firebase services.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Maps SDK:</strong> This SDK is used to provide map functionalities. Although Google Maps SDK itself does not use the AD ID, it may pull in permissions that could indirectly access this identifier when combined with other Google services.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Installations:</strong> This service generates unique installation identifiers. While it does not directly use the AD ID, it may collect device information for managing unique installations in connection with Firebase services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Collected Information</h3>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve app performance, functionality, and user experience.</li>
            <li>Diagnose and fix issues with app performance.</li>
            <li>Track anonymous analytics to understand how our app is used.</li>
            <li>Authenticate and provide secure access to user accounts.</li>
            <li>Facilitate payment processing and in-app purchases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Sharing and Transfer</h3>
        <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for advertising purposes. However, third-party services integrated into our app, like those provided by Google and Firebase, may collect and use data according to their privacy policies. For more details, please refer to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy and Security</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Managing AD ID Access</h3>
        <p>You can reset your Advertising ID or opt-out of interest-based ads in your device settings. For more details, please visit the <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2662922">Google Support page on ads settings</a>.</p>
